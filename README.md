##  4. Preceding Question Prompting

**Purpose:** Guide the AI to build context before giving the main response.

### Examples:
- “What should the chatbot ask before offering troubleshooting steps? Then provide the full message.”
- “Start with a question to confirm the product model, then explain how to update firmware.”
- “Ask the customer if they’ve already tried restarting the device before suggesting advanced fixes.”

### Sample Response:
> “Have you already tried restarting your device?  
If yes, here’s what we can do next:  
1. Check for firmware updates in the settings.  
2. Ensure the device is connected to Wi-Fi.  
3. Perform a factory reset if issues persist.”
